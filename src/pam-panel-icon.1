.TH PAM-PANEL-ICON 1 "2009-10-05" "Red Hat"
.SH NAME
pam-panel-icon \- A notification area indicator of pam_timestamp status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam\-panel\-icon
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pam\-panel\-icon
should be automatically started when starting an X11 desktop environment.
For example, in GNOME
.B gnome-session
should be configured to start \fBpam\-panel\-icon\fR.
In a properly configured system it should never be necessary to start
.B pam\-panel\-icon
manually.

.B pam\-panel\-icon
uses
.BR pam_timestamp_check (8)
to watch the
.B pam_timestamp
timestamp status.
If the
.B pam_timestamp
authorization is active,
allowing an unprivileted user to temporarily authenticate as the
.B root
user without providing a password,
an icon in the notification area of the panel is displayed.
The icon allows dropping the authorization immediately.

.SH EXIT STATUS
Ordinarily,
.B pam\-panel\-icon
keeps running until the X11 desktop session ends, and then returns 0.
.B pam\-panel\-icon
only returns with non-zero status on unexpected error.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fB/sbin/pam_timestamp_check\fR
A hard-coded location of the
.B pam_timestamp_check
executable.

.SH SEE ALSO
