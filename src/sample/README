This directory contains sample configuration files and scripts for using
consolehelper(8) as a wrapper for the shutdown-related commands halt(8),
poweroff(8) and reboot(8).

We generally suggest that such wrapping configuration should be packaged in
distributions together with the wrapped commands instead.

* shutdown: A wrapper script that allows users to use a subset of shutdown(8)
  invocations by redirecting them to wrapped versions of halt or poweroff,
  without giving them privileges to run shutdown(8) with other flags.

* wrapped.console: consolehelper(8) configuration for the wrapped commands.
  To be installed to /etc/security/console.apps/{halt,poweroff,reboot} .

  Also create a symlink from e.g. /usr/bin/{halt,poweroff,reboot} to
  /usr/bin/consolehelper .  The minimal configuration assumes that the
  underlying commands are installed in /usr/sbin/{halt,poweroff,reboot} .

* wrapped.pamd: A PAM configuration for the wrapped commands, allowing them to
  be run by anyone logged in at a local console.  To be installed to
  /etc/pam.d/{halt,poweroff,reboot} .
